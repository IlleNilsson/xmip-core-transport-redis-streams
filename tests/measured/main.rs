//! The module's timing program (`doc/governance/rust-style.md` section
//! 5c): this transport held to how long Xmip takes — the millisecond rule
//! (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, *Rust is here for one reason*). A plain `cargo test`
//! leaves it out; the landing runs it after every other test of the module,
//! alone, one test at a time
//! (`cargo test --test measured --all-features -- --test-threads=1`), so
//! what is measured is Xmip's work and not its neighbors':
//!
//! - a thousand reads on one connection take a millisecond each at most.
